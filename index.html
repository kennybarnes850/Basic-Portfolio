<h2>About me</h2>

<p> I am originally from Tallahassee, FL. After graduating from high school, I joined the United States Air Force. 
    While serving I was a part of Operation Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. I was stationed in numerous parts of the world including Ohio, Texas, England, Qatar, Kuwait, Dubai, Kentucky, Germany, and Canada. 
    After serving six years, I came back home and earned a bachelor's degree in social work from Florida A & M in 2013. Shortly after I decided to move to Atlanta, GA to work for the Department of Children and Family Services. 
    I have been a case manager for Cherokee, Newton, and Paulding County.
